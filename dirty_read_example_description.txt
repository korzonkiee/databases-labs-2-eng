Dirty Read Example : In the example below, Transaction 1, updates the value of ItemsInStock to 9. Then it starts to bill the customer. While Transaction 1 is still in progress, Transaction 2 starts and reads ItemsInStock value which is 9 at the moment. At this point, Transaction 1 fails because of insufficient funds and is rolled back. The ItemsInStock is reverted to the original value of 10, but Transaction 2 is working with a different value (i.e 10).
